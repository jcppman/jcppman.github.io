<h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>During my whole life, my soul is occupied by two things: Programming and Music.
The first one gives me job and keeps me survived while the second one &quot;absorbs&quot;
all the breads I earn, however, I love them both, equally.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-am-not-good-at">What I am not good at</h2>
<p>As a software engineer who has a master degree of computer science, it&#39;s kind of
a shame that I don&#39;t have tank-solid knowledges in algorithm or fields that
people might exptect me to have (I know how to invert binary-tree on whiteboard
though, lol).</p>
<h2 id="what-i-am-good-at">What I am good at</h2>
<p>I am good at learning new things, and I love to dig &amp; dive into something I
don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>The intern was separated into two stages. The first stage was a training phase.
We learned the basic computer graphic knowledge by implementing GPU rendering
pipelines on CPU in C++ with DirectX 3D, includes triangle rasterization,
perspective projection, texture binding and lighting. In the second stage, my
responsibility was the implementation of a global lighting system. I accomplished
the light tracing and photon mapping modules before my internship ended.</p>
