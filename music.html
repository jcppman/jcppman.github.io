<h3 id="blood-of-life">Blood of Life</h3>
<p>After almost one year of producing, this album is finally released! I play bass in this band but more importantly, this is the first time I produce something not written by myself. It was quite challenging because the standard was low when I&#39;m mixing for myself, but producing other ppl is another story.</p>
<p>Record other people&#39;s vocal is harder than I thought, as I need to figure out the right way to provide a usable cue mix for the singer to sing with comfort. I tried several different approaches making the singer able to hear herself in a natural way, includes some unconventional ways like a) place a condenser mic behind her to bring the sound of the room into the cue mix to make her &quot;forget&quot; the headphone b) replace the headphone with a pair of Bose QC20 earbuds, turn the &quot;aware mode&quot; on so the environment sound would leak into the cue mix directly through the earbuds.</p>
<p>Bring out mixes that all band members are happy with is even harder! After several failures, I decided to seek for help <a href="https://www.creativelive.com/bundle/geargods-presents-mastering-metal-mixing">here</a> and the courses are super awesome! After several cycles of feedbacks, arguments, and tweaks, the result is finally slightly acceptable and unwillingly nailed.</p>
<p>The road ahead is still steep and raw, keep mixing!</p>

<p>Even now, whenever I smell mouldy air, it will bring me back to the unforgettable
period of my life, back to those deep underground practice rooms in Beijing.
We&#39;re spread all over the world now, New York, Beijing, Shanghai... But the string
will keep vibrating, on and on, in a different form.</p>
<p>Songs below are by me and my old bandmates, I hope there will be more in the future.</p>

<h2 id="remote-collaborations">Remote Collaborations</h2>
<p>Internet is a true miracle, it eliminates the distance between people. Songs below
are collaborations with artists I&#39;ve never meet in real life. <strong><a href="mailto:jcppman@gmail.com">Shoot me a mail</a>
if you also want to brew something with me</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="let-me-out">Let me out</h3>
<p>This one is the result of my first <a href="https://kompoz.com">Kompoz</a> attempt, the
platform is really handy for ppl looking for online collaboration chances, and
while other similar platforms are more focus on electronic music, the majority
of this one is &quot;band stuff&quot;.</p>
