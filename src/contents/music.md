Music is a lifetime pursuit. Your taste might change, you might be listenning
to genres that you wouldn't touch 3 years ago, but it's still the love of music.

## Ever Lasting Metal Journey

### Blood of Life

After almost one year of producing, this album is finally released! I play bass in this band but more importantly, this is the first time I as a recording/mixing
engineer produce something not written by me.It was quite challenging because the standard is low when I'm mixing for myself.

Record other people's vocal is harder than I thought, as I need to figure out the right way to provide a usable cue mix for the singer to sing with comfort. I tried several different approaches making the singer able to hear herself in a natural way, includes some unconventional ways like a) place a condenser mic behind her to bring the sound of the room into the cue mix to make her "forget" the headphone b) replace the headphone with a pair of Bose QC20 earbuds, turn the "aware mode" on so the environment sound would leak into the cue mix directly through the earbuds.

Bring out mixes that other band members are happy with is even harder! After several failures, I decided to seek for help [here](https://www.creativelive.com/bundle/geargods-presents-mastering-metal-mixing) and the courses are super awesome! After several cycles of feedbacks, arguments, and tweaks, the result is finally slightly acceptable and unwillingly nailed.

The road ahead is still steep and raw, keep mixing!

## Electronify

For me making electronic music is somehow very similar to programming, a combination
of art and logic.

### Dubble

To one of my favorite TV series: Doctor Who.

## As Young As Ever

Even now, whenever I smell mouldy air, it will bring me back to the unforgettable
period of my life, back to those deep underground rehearsal rooms in Beijing.
We're spread all over the world now, New York, Beijing, Shanghai... But the string
will keep vibrating, on and on, in a different form.

Songs below are by me and my old bandmates, I hope there will be more in the future.

### I Surrender (Rainbow cover)

To the one and only Ronnie James Dio, rest in peace. \m/
