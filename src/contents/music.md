Music is a lifetime pursuit. Your taste might change, you might be listenning
to genres that you wouldn't touch 3 years ago, but it's still the love of music.

## Electronify

For me making electronic music is somehow very similar to programming, a combination
of art and logic.

### Dubble

To one of my favorite TV series: Doctor Who.

## As Young As Ever

Even now, whenever I smell mouldy air, it will bring me back to the unforgettable
period of my life, back to those deep underground rehearsal rooms in Beijing.
We're spread all over the world now, New York, Beijing, Shanghai... But the string
will keep vibrating, on and on, in a different form.

Songs below are by me and my old bandmates, I hope there will be more in the future.

### I Surrender (Rainbow cover)

To the one and only Ronnie James Dio, rest in peace. \m/

## Remote Collaborations

Internet is a true miracle, it eliminates the distance between people. Songs below
are collaborations with artists I've never meet in real life. **[Shoot me a mail](mailto:jcppman@gmail.com)
if you also want to brew something with me**.
