## Code Player

This app is a good example of something that is both useless and super fun.

Back to a normal working day in early 2014, TJ was still the big boss in town,
AngularJs was hot and trendily and haven't meet his arch enemy Re**t, nobody
would compiles javascript except coffescript evangelists, when people talk about
async in javascript, usually end the conversation with the comparison between
generator and promise and how they save us from callback hell.

I was debugging a perfectly crafted callback-based nodeJs application, with
my colleague [Eyal Arubas](http://eyalarubas.com/). The application was so
well organized that even if there were `function(err, data){` and `if(err) return
console.error(err);` all over the place and indents almost touch the
80-chars-limitation line, it still looks sort of beautiful, especially when you
look at it on Sublime's minimap. Rotate your neck by 90 degrees and you will
see the famous Yosemite. The mountain line goes up and down, bumps again
all the way up to the sky when you see it almost touching the ground.

The idea jumped into my mind, a briliant idea that is so useless that nobody
will ever try to implement it, so I can be the first one step on this borderland.
We all know how our codes look like, we're familiar with the visual
representation of codes, in all scales. But how about the aural representation?
